# 软件需求规范

## Preface

### Design Objectives

This software requirement specification (SRS) accurately describes the requirements and essential features for developing the project "The Jungle Game". Besides, it also describes some possible accidents which may occur during the development progress. 

Referring this specification will facilitate developers to better understand the users' requirements, baseline information on the target software and the features of each component, as well as help in coding at and maintaining in the future.

The specification is described in various formats including text, tables and flowcharts.

### Release Iteration Description

This specification is the 3rd official public version (V3.2) of the project, released on October 10, 2022. 

SRS shall be modified after requirements change. Therefore this article might not be the latest. Readers may access the newest documents on the project's online wiki at https://hirsun.github.io/COMP3211_Wiki/task/srs.html. Git also keeps track of where changes have been made and the old version.

### Expected Readers

The intended readers of this article are

- Product Managers
- Developers
- Customers of Deliverables
- Scholars of Software Engineering.

## Introduction

### Background

This project is a task whose main deliverable is a game, for teaching and evaluation purposes in HKPU's Software Engineering course for undergraduate in 2022 Fall. Members shall form groups on their own to complete the project in a standardized software development and project management procedure. 

### Overview

The main deliverable of this project is a game called "The Jungle Game". This game is a competition between 2 players on a board, which will result in a winner. Developers are required to design software according to game rules and deliver the product to customers.
